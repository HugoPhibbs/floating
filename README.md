# Etude 12: Floating

## Our approach

- We originally started this etude with Java, but Kate gave us the handy tip to instead to it in Python instead. This
  was due to the fact that using Python floats can avoid rounding errors that are possible with Java Doubles

## Running the program
- To run the program enter (from the top level project directory):
```shell
# TODO
```

## Testing the program
- We tested our program using Unittest, bellow is the test file that we used:
- Any supporting files can be found in the 'test' package
```python
# TODO
```
